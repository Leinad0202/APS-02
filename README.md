Python program that calculates CO₂ emissions for transport vehicles. It receives data on distance traveled and fuel consumption and estimates carbon emissions based on specific factors.

## How to Run  
1. Install Python 3.  
2. In the terminal, navigate to the project directory.  
3. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python cod_aps.py
Follow the instructions on the console (enter the requested values and get the emission result).

## Features
Automatic calculation of CO₂ emissions based on the provided data.

May include options to choose fuel type (gasoline, diesel, etc.) if implemented.

## Technologies
Pure Python (no external libraries).

## Learnings
Application of scientific calculation concepts in Python, console input/output, building a basic environmental analysis program.
